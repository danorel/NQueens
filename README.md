Project meant for Prolog subject as coursework

Hi! Welcome to my repo. 
Let me show you a short instruction how to launch the application.

The whole application is written in such stack:
- Backend: Python + Prolog insertions.
- Front-end: React.

### Local development configurations:
1. You need to install all dependencies in three core modules:
  - client
  - server
  - root (/)
  
2. Then return back to the root of the application and launch this command: ```npm run development:local```. 
In such way you will launch simultaneously both of back-end and front-end code.
